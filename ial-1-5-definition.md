Identity Assurance Level 1.5
============================


Critera and Use Case for this IAL:

This level is designed to be used when "some real world corroortation of identity" is given, but it does not meet NIST's IAL2.
A common use case is when a person self asserts their identity in person, such as COVID-19 vaccination site.  
This level does not require the person to show identification such as a driver's license.
