Identity Assurance Level 1.5 (DRAFT)
====================================


(Comments/collaboration welcome)

Critera for using IAL `1.5`:

This level is designed "some real world corroboration of identity" is given, but it does not meet NIST's IAL `2`.

Any of the following are acceptable forms of proof of identity for an Identity Assurance :evel  `1.5` designation.

* An insurance card, medicare Card, Medicaid Card, etc.
* 2nd party identity attestation.  (I have known Bob Smith for yearsm and attest that Bob Smith is Bob Smith.)
* A utility bill with an address
* Photo identification issued by a state or federal govenment, but does not meet the IAL2 Validatyion reequirements for "STRONG".

If requirements are met for IAL `2`, then IAL `2` should be used instead of IAL `1.5`.
