Identity Assurance Level 1.5 (DRAFT)
====================================


(Comments/collaboration welcome)

Critera for using IAL `1.5`:

This level is designed "some real world corroboration of identity" is given, but it does not meet NIST's IAL `2`.

Any of the following are acceptable forms of proof of identity for an Identity assurance level  `1.5` designation.

* An insurance card, medicare Card, Medicaid Card, etc.
* 2nd party identity attestation.  (I have known Bob Smith for yearsm and attest that Bob Smith is Bob Smith
* A utility bill with an address
* A successful login with associated account
* A cryptographic key verification 
* Presentation of a state or fereraly issued photo identificacation such as a Driver's licens, REALID, passport, military ID, etc.



In many cases verification of those documents such as a state or fereraly issued photo identificacation such as a Driver's licens, REALID, passport, military ID would result in a IAL of `2`.
