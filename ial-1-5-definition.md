Identity Assurance Level 1.5 (DRAFT)
====================================


This document aims to define some Identity Assurance Level(IAL) between NIST Digital Identity Guidelines IAL `1` and `2`. This alternative level was created to serve public health scenarios.  The `1/5` level is designed to show that "some real world corroboration of identity" is given, but it does not meet NIST's IAL `2` standards in some way.  This document is not published by NIST. This is a working draft document.  Comments and collaboration welcome. Use the Issues and Pull request features on Github to suggest changes.


Criteria for using IAL `1.5`:
----------------------------

Any of the following are acceptable forms of proof of identity for an Identity Assurance Level  `1.5` designation.

* An in-person encounter where some corroborating evidence is provided. Examples include non-photo identification such as  
insurance card, a Medicare/Medicard card, a utility bill, etc.
* 2nd party identity attestation.  "I, Bob, know Alice to be Alice."
* Photo identification issued by a state or federal government, but does not meet the IAL2 validation requirements for "STRONG".


Implementatation Guidance
-------------------------

If requirements are met for IAL `2`, then IAL `2` should be used instead of IAL `1.5`.
